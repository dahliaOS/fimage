// The SnapshotService enables you to list, insert, store, and retrieve
// snapshots.
//
// Currently there are two types of snapshots:
//
// - Local (default): These are snapshots that are created locally. They are
//     stored internally inside qcow2 files and are very efficient. These are
//     the snapshots usually created by interacting with the UI.
//
// - Remote: These are snapshots that have been exported at a certain point.
//     an exported snapshot is normalized (completely self contained) and
//     can be imported into an emulator with a similar hardware configuration.
//
// Currently the emulator has limited support for importing snapshots:
// - Once an imported snapshot has been loaded into an emulator it is no longer
// possible to create new snapshots.
// - The hardware configuration of the emulator your are pushing a snapshot to
// must match (or be very similar) to the one you pulled the snapshot from.
//
// For example do not expect to be able to restore a snapshot on created on an
// Intel cpu on an AMD cpu.
